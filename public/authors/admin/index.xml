      <description>Dr. Adrian Chong is an Assistant Professor in the Department of the Built Environment at the National University of Singapore (NUS). His research interest is in building energy modeling and simulation, focusing on model calibration and uncertainty quantification. At NUS, he leads the Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) lab, a multidisciplinary group researching the interaction between building performance simulation, measured data, and machine learning. Adrian is also the subject editor (validation, calibration, and uncertainty) for the journal Building Simulation and an NUS principal investigator at the SinBerBEST program Theme E - Cyber-Physical Testbed.</description>
