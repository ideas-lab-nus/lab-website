      <description>We have a new paper:
 Adrian Chong, Godfried Augenbroe and Da Yan (2021). Occupancy data at different spatial resolutions: Building energy performance and model calibration. Applied Energy. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116492 
 Occupancy is a significant area of interest within the field of building performance simulation. Through Bayesian calibration, the present study investigates the impact of the availability of different spatial resolution of occupancy data on the gap between predicted and measured energy use in buildings.</description>

      <description>Adrian Chong is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Building at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He specializes in building performance modelling and simulation, with expertise in uncertainty quantification and building data analytics. He leads the Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) research group, which engages in the interaction between building performance simulation, real-time data and machine learning.</description>
