New model features can improve the ability of a machine learning model to classify a person’s thermal preference. The spatial context of a building can provide information to models about the windows, walls, heating and cooling sources, air diffusers, and other factors that create micro-environments that influence thermal comfort. Due to spatial heterogeneity, it is impractical to position sensors at a high enough resolution to capture all conditions. This research aims to build upon an existing vector-based spatial model, called Build2Vec, for predicting spatial–temporal occupants’ indoor environmental preferences. Build2Vec utilizes the spatial data from the Building Information Model (BIM) and indoor localization in a real-world setting. This framework uses longitudinal intensive thermal comfort subjective feedback from smart watch-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The aggregation of these data is combined into a graph network structure (i.e., objects and relations) and used as input for a classification model to predict occupant thermal preference. The results of a test implementation show 14%–28% accuracy improvement over a set of baselines that use conventional thermal preference prediction input variables.\n","tags":["Spatial–temporal modeling","Building information models","Graph network structure","Personal thermal comfort model","Digital twin"],"title":"Personal thermal comfort models using digital twins: Preference prediction with BIM-extracted spatial–temporal proximity data from Build2Vec","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Yaonan (Claire) Gu","Hongyuan Jia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635692400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635692400,"objectID":"8ad78f41ccdea4aa46e7cf65f580a9c9","permalink":"/publication/chong-2021-calibrating/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2021-calibrating/","section":"publication","summary":"Building energy simulation (BES) plays a significant role in buildings with applications such as architectural design, retrofit analysis, and optimizing building operation and controls.

In the past few years, building occupancy, which is considered the basis of occupant behavior, has attracted increasing attention from researchers. There are increasing requirements for buildings to be both comfortable and energy efficient; with the development of detection methods and analyzing algorithms, occupancy prediction has become a topic of interest for building automation and energy conservation. Therefore, this article reviews the literature regarding future building occupancy predictions (forecasting). This review is distinguished from occupancy simulation and detection research and focuses on the research purpose, physical routine, and complete methodology of occupancy forecasting. First, the research purposes, including the application field and detailed requirements for occupancy forecasting, are summarized and analyzed. Next, an overall methodology of occupancy forecasting, including data acquisition, modeling techniques, and evaluation, is discussed in terms of issues affecting prediction performance. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives of occupancy forecasting are highlighted, considering the insights of natural characteristics, on-site implementation, valid dataset sharing, and research techniques. Overall, accurate and robust future occupancy predictions will help to improve building system operations and energy conservation.\n","tags":["Occupancy prediction","Forecasting","Occupant behavior","Building operation","Energy conservation"],"title":"Building occupancy forecasting: A systematical and critical review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Jin","Da Yan","Xuyuan Kang","Adrian Chong","Hongsan Sun","Sicheng Zhan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633964400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633964400,"objectID":"1c32bdfa5b81d51caad826b9defc9141","permalink":"/publication/jin-2021-forecasting/","publishdate":"2021-10-12T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jin-2021-forecasting/","section":"publication","summary":"Building occupancy is the basis for building energy simulations, operations, and management. With the increasing need for energy conservation and the occupant-centric service of building energy systems, occupancy forecasting has become an essential input for simulations. These applications include model predictive control and demand response, with the potential to optimize the use of renewable energy sources. Based on recent research, occupancy forecasting tends to be based on occupancy data of the previous time step or continuous lagged dependent variables. Previous analysis demonstrated that building occupancy is innately temporal and sequential with seasonal features, which may be instructive for forecast research. This study proposes a temporal-sequential (TS) analysis and machine learning integrated approach for occupancy forecasting. Using hourly occupant data from 16 different buildings, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal-sequential analysis using a 1-week seasonal period with an artificial neural network structure (TS-week-ANN) outperforms other baseline methods.\n","tags":["Energy forecasting","Occupant behavior","Occupancy prediction","Building operation"],"title":"Forecasting building occupancy: A temporal-sequential analysis and machine learning integrated approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sicheng Zhan","Yue Lei","Yuan, Jin","Yan, Da","Adrian Chong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633014000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633014000,"objectID":"7197ed8de33dea99ef9514c46ddbf124","permalink":"/publication/zhan-2022-impact/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhan-2022-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"Model predictive control (MPC) has shown potential in improving building performance but is bottlenecked by the difficulty in constructing control-oriented models. The challenge lies in evaluating the sufficiency of the model and the data usage beforehand. This paper bridges the knowledge gaps in the interactions between data requirements, model quality, and control performance by integrating real-world measurements and simulation-based experiments. The data usage related to occupancy and Internal heat gain (IHG) was studied considering its importance and the absence of consensus in the literature. Varying occupant-related data sources were tested as RC model inputs, including none, schedule, electricity consumption, CO2 ppm, and ideal measurement. Combinations of model inputs and complexities were examined for prediction and control in an office, a classroom, and multi-zone offices on one floor. The results indicated that the usefulness of data is jointly affected by three factors: measurement suitability, model complexity, and modeling purpose. Given the adequate model structure, satisfying prediction and control performance was achieved in offices with no detailed measurement. Meanwhile, electricity and CO2 were needed together to capture the IHG influence and realize the good performance for classrooms. The experiments also uncovered the heterogeneous requirements on models from traditional prediction tests and the control tasks. Lower prediction error did not always mean better control. More importantly, we provided the first quantitative demonstration of the complementary relationship between model adequacy and data informativeness with respect to different purposes. This study advocates the pioneering idea of sparse data usage and parsimonious modeling, which promotes the actual application of MPC in buildings by guiding control-oriented model development.\n","tags":["Model predictive control","Gray-box model","Data requirements","Model identification","Internal heat gain"],"title":"Impact of occupant related data on identification and model predictive control for buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eikichi Ono","Kuniaki Mihara","Khee Poh Lam","Adrian Chong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633014000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633014000,"objectID":"efe6dfe3b699f7bf5890790b07c21053","permalink":"/publication/ono-2022-effects/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ono-2022-effects/","section":"publication","summary":"Incorporating data-driven thermal comfort models into occupant-centric HVAC controls is crucial to meet occupants’ preferences in thermal comfort. Although HVAC controls and thermal comfort modeling are highly inter-related, the interactions between their various resolutions require further study for a better understanding. This study aims to establish the effects of a mismatch between the occupancy resolutions of thermal comfort modeling and HVAC controls. We evaluated the energy and thermal comfort performance of different combinations of thermal comfort models and HVAC controls, focusing on their occupancy resolutions (zone, group, and personal thermal comfort models and zone, group, and personal HVAC controls). A mismatch between thermal comfort modeling and HVAC controls can result in a 6–12% decrease in occupants voting “no change” in thermal and air movement preference. Energy savings can be increased by more than 10% when considering a suitable comfort model for the HVAC control. The results demonstrate the importance of selecting a thermal comfort model with an appropriate occupancy resolution commensurate with the resolution of the HVAC controls.\n","tags":["Occupant-centric control","Personal comfort model","Occupancy","Thermal comfort","Thermal preference","HVAC control"],"title":"The effects of a mismatch between thermal comfort modeling and HVAC controls from an occupancy perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This research has a total project value of S$3.75 million and is supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore under its Cities of Tomorrow R\u0026amp;D Programme, and administered by the Building Construction Authority.\n","date":1625673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625673600,"objectID":"31d1ecd9771ff1dfef07752c34ec0c14","permalink":"/project/cot_mixed_mode/","publishdate":"2021-07-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/cot_mixed_mode/","section":"project","summary":"This research has a total project value of S$3.75 million and is supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore under its Cities of Tomorrow R\u0026amp;D Programme, and administered by the Building Construction Authority.","tags":["Building Performance Simulation","Building Controls","Model Calibration"],"title":"A Total Building Performance Approach to Real-time Occupant Centric Sensing and Control for Mixed Mode Ventilation in the Tropics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Building energy modeling has become more widely used for building performance assessment and building regulations compliance.

Increasing monitoring of electricity consumption generates a real opportunity for gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature of occupant-related internal loads and the connection between activity and demand. The stochastic nature of the demand is well-known but as yet there is no accepted methodology for generating stochastic loads for building energy simulation. This paper presents evidence that it is feasible to generate stochastic models of activity-related electricity demand based on monitored data. Two machine learning approaches are used to develop stochastic models of plug loads; an autoencoder (AE) and a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) model. Using data from two office buildings located in different countries, the transferability of models is explored by training the models on data from one building and using the trained models to predict demand for the other building. The results show that both models predict plug loads satisfactorily, with a good agreement with the mean demand and quantification of the uncertainty.\n","tags":["Electricity demand, Plug loads, Stochastic model, Machine learning, Transferability, Autoencoder (AE), Functional Data Analysis (FDA)"],"title":"A study on the transferability of computational models of building electricity load patterns across climatic zones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sicheng Zhan","Adrian Chong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614870000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614870000,"objectID":"ef10697926000f93083bbe812ed72e81","permalink":"/publication/zhan-2021-data/","publishdate":"2021-03-05T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhan-2021-data/","section":"publication","summary":"Model predictive control (MPC) has shown great potential in improving building performance and saving energy.

CWC evaluates the PIs based on both their coverage (correctness) and width (informativeness). This investigation takes the form of an actual building case study, with nine months of hourly measured building electricity use, WiFi connection counts as a proxy for occupancy, and actual weather data. In general, the building energy model’s accuracy improves with the occupancy and plug-loads schedule derived from WiFi data. Specifically, the Coefficient of Variation Root Mean Square Error (CV[RMSE]) reduced from 37% to 24% with an exponential improvement in the PIs quality compared to the results obtained with ASHRAE 90.1 reference schedules. However, the increase in prediction accuracy shrank to 5% CV(RMSE) and a comparable CWC upon calibrating the base loads of the reference schedules. Increasing the spatial resolution from building aggregated to floor aggregated occupancy data worsened the CV(RMSE) and CWC, suggesting trade-offs between parameter uncertainty and model bias/inadequacy.

However, its actual implementation is restricted by the high configuration cost. Control-oriented model is the cornerstone of MPC and the most challenging part. Due to the paucity of a systematic understanding, it is also hard to estimate the efforts required to obtain the model. Therefore, this study aims at improving the scalability of MPC by addressing modeling-related issues and establishing an automated framework.\nWhile many past studies demonstrated the usefulness of MPC through simulation and experiments, more attention is required for quantifiable relationships between data requirement, model performance, and control performance. The data used to obtain the model and implement control is essential for the ultimate performance. However, data availability and quality vary among different buildings. Therefore, an important question for scalability is what data is necessary and/or desired. On the other hand, it is unclear how the predictive capability of control-oriented models affects the control performance. The answer to this question involves a model performance evaluation approach, which tests not just the predictive accuracy, and series of experiments to quantify the relationships.\nVirtual testbeds with single and multi-zone emulators are implemented to address the questions. Different data availability conditions are designed to obtain alternative control-oriented models. All alternatives are comprehensively evaluated in terms of prediction and control performance. Thereby, quantitative relationships between data requirement, model performance, and control performance are established.

Comparing with the isolated building system optimization, a combination of passive and active strategies is generally recognized that can result in a lower life-cycle cost (LCC) with better energy performance in the literature. With the passive design parameters being optimized, the heating and cooling load of the building could be decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the HVAC system. for integrated building design. However, in the current cost-optimal decision-making framework, there is no difference in the costing process whether it is performed on the integrated building system or the single system energy optimization. Although the dynamic energy simulation can well demonstrate the energy benefit gained from the integrated design, the cost-benefit usually be highly underestimated due to the little considering of the effect that load reductions have on the capital and running costs of the HVAC system.\nAgainst this background, this research proposes a holistic LCC optimization approach for the integrated building design, which concerns the cost integration between passive design and HVAC costs and the tradeoff between initial investment for ECMs and long-term benefits. Three LCC optimization methods are performed for the case study and their impact on Pareto front solutions’ energy and cost performance is compared in this study. This research can contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of the cost-effectiveness in energy conservation, which is the basis for successful design decisions and policy implementation.\nTo improve energy efficiency, evaluating the energy savings potential of energy conservation measures (ECMs) is a critical task. During new buildings design or building retrofits, occupancy and plug-loads schedules can significantly impact building energy use and is a leading factor in uncertainty when determining the effectiveness of ECMs and operation strategies. Current simulation-based assessment methods simplify the occupancy related schedules by using a standard or representative set of static and homogeneous assumptions. The simplification contributes to significant gaps between the simulated and measured actual energy performance of buildings.\nThis study presents a framework for identifying and quantifying the impact of occupancy-related schedules on ECMs’ performance using building energy simulation. An institutional building located in Singapore is used for a case study. Two spatial resolution and five temporal resolution are combined to establish different base models for energy simulation, representing different accuracy levels of occupancy-related schedules. Then, a simulation workflow is performed for each ECM to determine its energy savings under different levels of input schedules. Finally, the ECM decision is determined based on the simulated energy performance and compared among different base models. This research can contribute to our understanding of the interactions between model complexity and energy efficiency design, facilitating future discussions on the right level of abstraction when modeling occupancy in building performance simulation.\n","date":1596816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596816000,"objectID":"37c625ff86c64c60d8c25d130f8b39b3","permalink":"/project/lcc/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/lcc/","section":"project","summary":"Life cycle cost optimization","tags":["Building Performance Simulation"],"title":"Life cycle cost optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Building energy simulation (BES) offers an alternative approach that encourages customized, integrated design solutions, and the development of BES tools has been pronounced over the decades. The core tools are the whole-building energy simulation programs that provide users with key building performance indicators such as energy use and demand, temperature, humidity, and costs. However, BES, with an iterative nature inside, can produce a large amount of data. The volumes of the data have overwhelmed traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with a large number of factors to be considered. Solutions in most existing software and applications have limited post-processing capacities on BES results. They are not flexible enough to enable a clear understanding and control of how the data is being transformed. There is a need to improve the efficacy and integration between data-driven analytics and BES, and efforts should be made to develop integrated tools that are capable of leveraging both methods.\nAs BES becomes more integral to many aspects of architecture design and decision-making processes, computational reproducibility has become increasingly important to researchers, designers and practitioners. Lack of credibility in BES results due to a lack of reproducibility is widely considered a problem by the energy modeling community. Issues in simulation reproducibility are mainly caused by the absence of (1) an integrated workflow between BES and data-driven analytics and (2) a portable and reusable computational environment encapsulating essential software and applications to perform it.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a new framework for integrating BES and data-driven analytics. The framework is different from existing ones because of its data-centric design philosophy. The objectives are:\n to provide better and more seamless integration between BES engine EnergyPlus and R-programming data-driven analytics environment through a parametric simulation prototype with structured inputs and outputs format. to build infrastructures for portable and reusable BES computational environment to facilitate reproducibility research in building energy domain.

Grouping buildings with diverse operations for benchmarking could result in misleading results. The smart meters provide an opportunity to feature the dynamic characteristics of building operations, but proper data mining techniques are needed to use the data for benchmarking. Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework that makes use of the time-series energy consumption data to categorize buildings by their operations and conduct energy benchmarking within each category. The proposed framework is based on 3-step K-means clustering and consists of two main parts: (1) Operation quantification, and (2) Building categorization and benchmarking. The framework was tested on a dataset of 81 buildings in Singapore. Two baseline methods were also implemented for comparison. The results show that the proposed framework successfully categorized the buildings by their operational similarities and made a significant impact on the energy benchmarking results. Further, the superiority of operation-based energy benchmarking is manifested by investigating two typical buildings where the proposed framework disagreed with the baselines. It is necessary to integrate building operations in energy benchmarking so that the energy performance is evaluated more precisely and higher energy saving potential can be uncovered.\n","tags":["Building energy benchmarking","Smart meter","Clustering","Building operation","Energy conservation"],"title":"Building categorization revisited: A clustering-based approach to using smart meter data for building energy benchmarking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Song Chao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567871248,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567871248,"objectID":"3fe2fedf0a136109e8aed3feaed9fef0","permalink":"/publication/chong-2019-continuous/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T17:47:28+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2019-continuous/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A framework for the continuous Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weili Xu","Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Haopeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567782000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567782000,"objectID":"b1fc56c9cc3a2c6177edc9e83a52472e","permalink":"/publication/xu-2019-gbeplus/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2019-gbeplus/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A new BIM to BEM framework: The development and verification of an open-source gbXML to EnergyPlus translator for supporting building life cycle performance analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Sicheng","Adrian Chong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567782000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567782000,"objectID":"5eae38d30a7863d86b9732986073c37e","permalink":"/publication/zhan-2019-robust/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhan-2019-robust/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A robust unsupervised framework for high-resolution building energy consumption profiling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Weili Xu","Song Chao","Ngoc-Tri Ngo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546268400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546268400,"objectID":"7f50ff644e6ba2a61e7276fd711503b5","permalink":"/publication/chong-2019177/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2019177/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study proposes a framework for the continuous Bayesian calibration of whole building energy simulation (BES) models utilizing data from building information models (BIM) and building energy management systems (BEMS). The ability to import data from BIM and BEMS provides the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort needed for the continuous calibration of BES models. First, five gbXML geometric test cases were used to check the BIM to BES model translation. Translation of the test cases indicates good geometric agreement between the native BIM and the gbXML-based BES model. An actual building calibration case study (with BIM and three years of monthly electrical energy consumption data) was then used to evaluate the proposed continuous calibration method. The results suggest that compared to a non-continuous approach, the continuous Bayesian calibration method showed reduced prediction uncertainty and improved prediction accuracy on a test dataset. The paper also presents information and comparison of the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) and the normalized mean biased error (NMBE), recommending looking at their distributions when working with probabilistic BES predictions.","tags":["Energy simulation","Continuous calibration","Bayesian calibration","Uncertainty analysis","Building information models (BIM)","Green building XML (gbXML)"],"title":"Continuous-time Bayesian calibration of energy models using BIM and energy data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiang Zhang","Adrian Chong","Yuqi Pan","Chenlu Zhang","Khee Poh Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546268400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546268400,"objectID":"85d359c5a8e9e2f0aaf32275cc0e70ed","permalink":"/publication/zhang-2019472/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2019472/","section":"publication","summary":"Whole building energy model (BEM) is a physics-based modeling method for\nbuilding energy simulation.

With measures in place to meet this 80% target, the number of Green Mark certified buildings has grown significantly from 17 during the launch of the BCA Green Mark scheme in 2005 to more than 2100 in 2014. With the exponential increase in the number of Green Mark certified buildings, there is an urgent need for the verification of their actual performance. The need to \u0026ldquo;validate performance, raise and build awareness and capability\u0026rdquo; has also been identified as one of the key initiatives of the S\\$52 Million Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) Fund allocated by the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF), in the most recent third green building masterplan released by BCA. Currently, the best practices for M\u0026amp;V are documented in several guidelines, including the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), ASHRAE Guideline 14 and M\u0026amp;V Guidelines prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). Most of these efforts are driven by the need to use a BEM to predict the savings of different Energy Conservation Measures (ECM).

Urban materials absorb solar and infrared radiation and the accumulated heat is dissipated in the atmosphere increasing further the air temperature. Roofs are envelope components which with advanced solutions such as cool roofs or green roofs can provide significant energy savings in air-conditioned buildings and improved indoor thermal conditions. By means of dynamic simulations in EnergyPlus software a numerical comparative analysis between these two solutions was done in a tropical climate like Singapore’s, taking into account climatological, thermal, optical and hydrological variables. Simulations of a typical summer day in Singapore were assessed to determine (i) UHI reductions for different green/cool roof scenarios; (ii) the diurnal heat fluxes dynamics and (iii) the buildings’ thermal energy reduction for the investigated cases. The results show that during peak periods (9 am to 5 pm) cool roofs reduce heat gain by about 0.14 KWh/m2 (8%) and green roofs mitigate considerably less to about 0.008 KWh/m2 (0.4%). And for the whole of a summer design day, cool and green roof reduces heat gain by 15.53 (37%) and 13.14 (31%) KWh/m2 respectively. The numerical simulation results confirm that an appropriate selection of roof materials contribute to the reduction of the negative effects of UHI but experimental data for air-conditioned buildings are yet to be carried out.","tags":["Green roof","Cool roof","Tropical climate","Energy efficiency","Mitigation potential"],"title":"Green and cool roofs’ urban heat island mitigation potential in tropical climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Kathrin Menberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514732400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514732400,"objectID":"23a0c2f63f7634f54684d7ffcdaabc3f","permalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides practical guidelines to the Bayesian calibration of building energy models using the probabilistic programming language Stan.

Using a case study, we demonstrate the application of Kennedy and O’Hagan’s (KOH) [1] Bayesian calibration framework to an EnergyPlus whole building energy model. The case study is used to analyze the sensitivity of the posterior distributions to the number of calibration parameters. The study also looks into the influence of prior specification on the resulting (1) posterior distributions; (2) calibrated predictions; and (3) model inadequacy that is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions. Results from the case study suggest that over-parameterization can result in a significant loss of posterior precision. Additionally, using strong prior information for the calibration parameters may dominate any influence from the data leading to poor posterior inference of the calibration parameters. Lastly, this study shows that it may be misleading to assume that the posteriors of the calibration parameters are representative of their true values and their associated uncertainty simply because the calibrated predictions matches the measured output well.","tags":["Bayesian calibration","Building energy modeling","Building simulation","Gaussian process","Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"],"title":"Guidelines for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483196400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483196400,"objectID":"6a476c22afa1cb96b5f4a029efee8e1a","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of MCMC algorithms for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Matteo Pozzi","Junjing Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483196400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483196400,"objectID":"1e91ce185661e0cc2cc2dd9864896edf","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian calibration as proposed by Kennedy and O’Hagan [22] has been increasingly applied to building energy models due to its ability to account for the discrepancy between observed values and model predictions.

This study focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by: (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with Gelman–Rubin statistics Rˆ within 1±0.1.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of these two strategies compared to conventional algorithms, a case study was conducted.

The integration of design tools with microclimate assessment tools therefore attest to be one with a promising future. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the building performance of offices in Singapore whilst taking into account its surrounding morphology using GIS as a platform for integration with an urban climatic assessment tool. Hourly weather data which accounts for the urban morphology (input to the model) is obtained by morphing maximum, minimum and average temperature (the output of air prediction model STEVE) into a typical 24h profile. Good agreement was found between predicted dry-bulb temperatures and measured data. A total of two indicators of envelope performance were used and they are (1) increase in conduction (wall, window and roof) heat gain and (2) solar heat gain through glazing taking into account shading by surrounding buildings and morphology.

Field measurements were also conducted at food centres in Singapore to determine if they are coherent with the objective and subjective measurements conducted. Analysis of objective and subjective data showed that the misting fan was able to significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature and thermal sensation votes. This is consistent with field measurements taken, where regression analysis showed that with the misting fan, thermal neutrality can be obtained at a higher outdoor effective temperature (ET*). However, the reduction in temperature comes at the expense of higher relative humidity which results in consistently greater biological (bacterial and fungal) pollutants being enumerated from samples collected under the misting fan system. In some samples, the bacteria count is very much greater than samples collected under the non-misting fan, illustrating the potential for a substantial increase in biological pollutants due to the generation of mists.","tags":["Misting fan","Evaporative cooling","Singapore","Hot","Humid"],"title":"Performance evaluation of misting fans in hot and humid climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
