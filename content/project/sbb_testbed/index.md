Building energy modeling has become more widely used for building performance assessment and building regulations compliance. The energy model of the SinBerBEST Cyber Physical Testbed provides a straightforward “virtual testbed” platform for evaluating the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of technological innovations. 

However, before using for technological assessments, the testbed model itself should be calibrated using in-situ experiments from various operation conditions to make sure it follows reasonably the real thermal and energy performance of the testbed. Besides, the dataset derived from the calibration experiments could be processed to form a high-quality open empirical dataset which is rare found in current model calibration research. The open datasets can be used to assess the predictive accuracy and evaluate different calibration algorithms.

The main objectives of this experiment are:

1.	To calibrate the SinBerBEST Testbed EnergyPlus model using in-situ experiments

2.	To obtain high-quality experimental datasets for building energy model validation/calibration of thermal and energy performance.
