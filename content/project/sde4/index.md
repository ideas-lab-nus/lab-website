To improve energy efficiency, evaluating the energy savings potential of energy
conservation measures (ECMs) is a critical task. During new buildings design or
building retrofits, occupancy and plug-loads schedules can significantly impact
building energy use and is a leading factor in uncertainty when determining the
effectiveness of ECMs and operation strategies. Current simulation-based
assessment methods simplify the occupancy related schedules by using a standard
or representative set of static and homogeneous assumptions. The simplification
contributes to significant gaps between the simulated and measured actual energy
performance of buildings.

This study presents a framework for identifying and quantifying the impact of
occupancy-related schedules on ECMs’ performance using building energy
simulation. An institutional building located in Singapore is used for a case
study. Two spatial resolution and five temporal resolution are combined to
establish different base models for energy simulation, representing different
accuracy levels of occupancy-related schedules. Then, a simulation workflow is
performed for each ECM to determine its energy savings under different levels of
input schedules. Finally, the ECM decision is determined based on the simulated
energy performance and compared among different base models. This research can
contribute to our understanding of the interactions between model complexity and
energy efficiency design, facilitating future discussions on the right level of
abstraction when modeling occupancy in building performance simulation.
