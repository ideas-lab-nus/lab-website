Yuzhen Peng is a senior postdoctoral fellow in the [[Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg). Her research background covers academia and industry. She specializes in smart buildings and systems using diverse technologies. To achieve energy-efficient and comfortable buildings, a set of learning-based demand-driven controls she developed have been successfully implemented in a real-world building. One of the related publications has been awarded the annual Best Paper by Journal Building and Environment. For her industrial research, Yuzhen also joined the design to transform research into practical products for the global market.
