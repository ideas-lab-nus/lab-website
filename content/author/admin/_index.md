Dr. Adrian Chong is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg). His research interest is in building energy modeling and simulation, focusing on building energy efficiency, model calibration, and occupant-centric building operation. At NUS, he leads the Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) lab, a multidisciplinary group researching the interaction between building performance simulation, measured data, and machine learning. Adrian is also the subject editor (validation, calibration, and uncertainty) for the journal [Building Simulation](https://www.springer.com/journal/12273), an Early Career Board Member for the journal [Building and Environment](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/building-and-environment), and an NUS principal investigator at the SinBerBEST program [Theme E - Cyber-Physical Testbed](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/research/theme-e-cyber-physical-testbed).
