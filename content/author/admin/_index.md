Dr. Adrian Chong is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) and a Fellow of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA). His research interest is is rooted in addressing the multi-faceted challenges of optimizing building energy efficiency and performance.At the core of this endeavor are his interest in model calibration, uncertainty quantification, and occupant-centric building controls. At NUS, he leads the Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) lab, a multidisciplinary group researching the interaction between building performance simulation, measured data, and machine learning. Adrian also serves as a subject editor for the journal [Building Simulation](https://www.springer.com/journal/12273) and holds the role of Early Career Board Member for the journal [Building and Environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/building-and-environment).
