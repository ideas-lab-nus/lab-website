Hongyuan Jia is a postdoctoral fellow at the [Berkeley Education Alliance for
Rearch in Singapore](http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/). He specializes in
building performance modelling and simulation, with expertise in parametric
building modelling tooling and analysis. He is the author of R package
[eplusr](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr),
[epluspar](hongyuanjia.github.io/epluspar),
[epwshiftr](ideas-lab-nus.github.io/epwshiftr/) which provides a rich toolkit
for doing parametric building energy simulation using EnergyPlus under climate
changes.
